[[Testing]] must adapt to the [[SDLC]] for it to succeed

[[SDLC]] impacts in Scope and timing of test activities (test levels, and test types)
[[SDLC]] impacts in Level of detail of test documentation
[[SDLC]] impacts in Choice of test techniques and test approach
[[SDLC]] impacts in Extent of test automation
[[SDLC]] impacts in Roles and responsibilities of a tester

In sequential development models, typically [[Dynamic testing]] cannot be performed early in the [[SDLC]]

In some iterative development models, each iteration require [[Static testing]] and [[Dynamic testing]] 
Frequent delivery of increments requires fast feedback and extensive regression testing [[SDLC]]

Agile software development assumes that change may occur throughout the project
[[Manual testing]] tends to be done using experience-based [[Test techniques]] ([[4.4 Experience-based Test Techniques]]) that do not require extensive prior [[test analysis]] and [[design]]
