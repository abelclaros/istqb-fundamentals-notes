[[DevOps]] promotes team autonomy, fast feedback, integrated toolchains, and technical practices like [[Continuous Integration]] and [[Continuous Delivery]]

[[DevOps]] benefit - fast feedback on code quality
[[DevOps]] benefit - [[Continuous Integration]] promotes [[2.1.5 Shift Left]] in testing
[[DevOps]] benefit - promote automated processes like [[Continuous Integration]] and [[Continuous Delivery]], to stablish stable test environments
[[DevOps]] benefit - the visibility on non-functional quality characteristics increases
[[DevOps]] benefit - Automation through a delivery pipeline reduces the need for repetitive manual testing 
[[DevOps]] benefit - reduces the risk of regression 

[[DevOps]] risk - pipeline must be defined
[[DevOps]] risk - [[Continuous Delivery]]/[[Continuous Integration]] tools must be introduced and maintained
[[DevOps]] risk - Test automation requires additional resources
