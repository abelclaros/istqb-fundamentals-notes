[[Test-Driven Development]] TDD - Directs coding through [[Test cases]] 
[[Test-Driven Development]] TDD - Test are written first, then code is written to satisfy the tests, and then tests and code are refactored

[[4.5.3 Acceptance Test-driven Development (ATDD)]] - Derives test from acceptance criteria as part of the system design process
[[4.5.3 Acceptance Test-driven Development (ATDD)]] - Tests are written before the part of the application is developed to satisfy the tests 

[[Behavior-Driven Development]] - Expressed the desired behavior of an application with test cases written in a simple form of natural language (Given/When/Then)
[[Behavior-Driven Development]]  - Test cases should then automatically be translated into executable tests
