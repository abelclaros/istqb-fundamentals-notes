```ad-abstract
- [[Testing]] detects [[defect|defects]], then [[Debugging]] (non- testing activity) they get removed - so [[Testing]] indirectly contributes to higher quality objects
- [[Testing]] provides a means of directly evaluating the quality of a [[test object]] at various phases in the SDLC - This measures are used by project management activities, contributes to decisions in SDLC
- [[Testing]] ensure the users' needs are considered throughout the development lifecycle - so we can avoid the involvement of a set of users in the process
```

- Efficiency on defect detection
	- Testing is a cost effective to identify defects in test objects 
	- Debugging can remove this defects, indirectly improving the quality of the test objects
- Quality evaluation in phases:
	- Testing directly evaluates the quality of an object at various phases of SDLC
	- Those measures help in the decision making for the next phases of SDLC
- Testing ensures that the understanding of users' needs are considered throughout the development cycle
	- Using users to do this is not economically and technically viable
- Also helps meeting contractual or legal requirements
