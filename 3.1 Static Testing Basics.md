In [[Static testing]] software under test does not need to be executed
In [[Static testing]], code, process specification , system architecture specification or other work products are evaluated through manual examination (e.g. [[Reviews]]) or with the help of a tool (e.g. [[Static analysis]])
[[Static testing]] [[Test objectives]] include improving quality, detecting defects and assessing characteristics like readability, completeness, correctness, testability and consistency.
[[Static testing]] can be applied for both [[Verification]] and [[Validation]]

[[Static analysis]] can identify problems prior to dynamic testing while often requiring less effort
