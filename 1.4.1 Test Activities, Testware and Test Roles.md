Following activities are not locked to a logical sequence, the can be implemented in parallel/iteratively. 
They need to be tailored
- [[Test Planning]] defines [[test objectives]].  
- [[Test Planning]] selects best approach to better achieve defined objectives [[5.1 Managing the Test Activities]]

- [[Test Monitoring]] involves checking all [[Test activities]]
- [[Test Monitoring]] involves comparison of actual progress against the plan [[5.3 Test Monitoring, Test Control and Test Completion]]
- [[Test control]] takes actions to meet the [[test objectives]] [[5.3 Test Monitoring, Test Control and Test Completion]]

- [[Test analysis]] analyzes the [[test basis]] to identify [[testable features]] 
- [[Test analysis]] defines and prioritizes [[Test conditions]], taking into account related risks and [[risk levels]] [[5.2 Risk Management]]
- [[Test analysis]] evaluates the [[test basis]] and [[test object]] to identify defects they may contain and to assess their testability
- [[Test analysis]] is supported by the use of [[Test techniques]] [[4. Test Analysis and Design]]
- [[Test analysis]] answers the question "what to test?" in terms of measurable coverage criteria

- [[Test design]] elaborates [[Test conditions]] into [[test case|test cases]] and other [[testware]]
- [[Test design]] identifies coverage items, which serve as a guide to specify [[test case|test cases]] inputs
- [[Test design]] is supported by [[Test techniques]] [[4. Test Analysis and Design]]
- [[Test design]] defines test data requirements
- [[Test design]] defines [[test environment]] and identifies necessary infrastructure and tools
- [[Test design]] answers the question "how to test?"

- [[Test implementation]] creates or acquiring the [[testware]] for [[test execution]] 
- [[Test implementation]] organizes [[test case|test cases]] in [[test procedures]], which are assembled into [[test suites]]. Manual and automated [[test scripts]] are created
- [[Test implementation]] prioritizes and arranges [[test procedures]]within a [[test execution]] schedule [[5.1.5 Test Case Prioritization]]. [[test environment]] is built and verified to be set up correctly

- [[test execution]] runs the tests in accordance with the [[test execution]] schedule, it can be manual or automated
- [[test execution]] compares actual test results with the expected results, [[Test results]] are logged, anomalies are analyzed to identify their likely causes
- [[test execution]] analysis allows the report the anomalies based on the failures observed [[5.5 Defect Management]]

- [[test completion]] usually occurs at [[project milestones]] (release, end of iteration, test level, completion)
- [[test completion]] creates change requests or product backlog items for any unresolved [[defect|defects]]
- [[test completion]] identifies/archives/hands over the [[testware]] that may be useful in the future
- [[test completion]] shuts down the [[test environment]]
- [[test completion]] analyzes [[Test activities]] to identify lessons learned
- [[test completion]] creates a report that is communicated to the stakeholders
