```ad-abstract
[[Testing]] finds defects ([[Static testing]]), or triggers failures ([[Dynamic testing]])
[[Debugging]] analyzes and corrects them.
```

- [[Debugging]] is the development activity that finds, analyses, and corrects [[defect|defects]] (Debugging removes the defect). Process:
	- Reproduction of failure
	- Diagnosis (finding the defect)
	- Fixing the defect
- [[Dynamic testing]] can trigger failures in the software ([[4. Test Analysis and Design]])
- [[Static testing]] directly find defects in the test object - [[Static testing]] cannot cause failures [[3. Static Testing]]
- [[Confirmation testing]] is done after fix is up ([[2.2.3 Confirmation Testing and Regression Testing]])
