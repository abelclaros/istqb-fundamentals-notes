[[Test Type]] [[Functional Testing]] - Evaluates the functions that a component or a system should perform. The functions are "what" the test object should do.
[[Test Type]] [[Functional Testing]] - Main objective is to check the functional completeness, functional correctness and functional appropriateness

[[Test Type]] [[Non-functional Testing]] - Evaluates attributes of a component or system. Tests "how well the system behaves"
[[Test Type]] [[Non-functional Testing]] - Main objective is to check the non-functional quality characteristics 
[[Test Type]] [[Non-functional Testing]] examples - Performance, Compatibility, Usability, Reliability, Security, Maintainability, Portability, Safety.

[[Test Type]] [[Black-box Testing]] - It is specification based and derives from documentation not related to the internal structure of the test object.
[[Test Type]] [[Black-box Testing]] - Main objective is to check the system's behavior against its specifications

[[Test Type]] [[White-box Testing]] - It is structure based and derives from the system's implementation ro internal structure (e.g., code, architecture, data flows)
[[Test Type]] [[White-box Testing]] - Main objective is to cover the underlying structure by tests to an acceptable level

[[Functional Testing]], [[Non-functional Testing]], [[Black-box Testing]], and [[White-box Testing]] can be applied to all test levels, although the focus will be different at each level
