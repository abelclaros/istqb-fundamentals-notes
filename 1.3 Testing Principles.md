[[Testing principles]]
# 1. [[Testing]] shows the presence, not the absence of defects
Testing can prove the presence of defects, but it cannot prove the absence of defects
# 2. Exhaustive [[testing]] is impossible
Instead we should use test techniques [[4. Test Analysis and Design]], test case prioritization [[5.1.5 Test Case Prioritization]], and risk based testing [[5.2 Risk Management]]
# 3. Early [[testing]] saves time and money
[[DE237351 User id incorrect after entering Crew information in train history]] removed early in the process reduce the cost of quality
To find defects early, use [[3. Static Testing]], and Dynamic testing [[4. Test Analysis and Design]] should be used as early as possible
# 4. [[DE237351 User id incorrect after entering Crew information in train history]] cluster together
Pareto principle, a small number of system components usually contain most of the defects discovered
# 5. [[Tests]] wear out
If tests are repeated many times, they become increasingly ineffective
New data may be needed, or new test may need to be designed
# 6. [[Testing]] is context dependent
There is no single universally applicable approach to testing. Testing is done differently in different contexts
# 7. Absence-of-[[DE237351 User id incorrect after entering Crew information in train history]] fallacy
A perfect product ( no defects) still can fail on fulfilling users' needs and expectations
